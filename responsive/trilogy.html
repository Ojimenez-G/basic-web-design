            <img class="movie_post" src="images/venom1.jpg" alt="venom 1">
            <p>The first film introduces audiences to Eddie Brock, a down-on-his-luck investigative journalist who becomes an unwitting host to a powerful alien symbiote known as Venom. After uncovering illegal experiments being conducted by the shady Life Foundation, Eddie is exposed to the symbiote, which bonds with him and gives him enhanced strength, agility, and a hunger for chaos. The relationship between Eddie and Venom begins as hostile and chaotic but quickly grows into a darkly humorous and bizarrely cooperative partnership. Together, they must confront Carlton Drake, the ambitious and unethical head of the Life Foundation, who becomes the host of Riot — another symbiote with deadly intentions. With intense action, dark comedy, and an unconventional anti-hero dynamic, Venom set the tone for a fresh take on the superhero genre, rooted in duality and inner conflict.</p>

                   <h3>Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)</h3>
            <img class="movie_post" src="images/venom_2_let.jpg" alt="venom let there be carnage">
            <p>In the sequel, Eddie and Venom are now navigating life as reluctant roommates, still clashing over their vastly different views on morality, diet, and day-to-day existence. But their bond is put to the test when Eddie is called to interview Cletus Kasady, a psychotic serial killer who forms a terrifying connection with his own symbiote, Carnage. As Carnage and Cletus go on a violent rampage, Eddie and Venom must learn to overcome their differences and fight together to stop this new and even more dangerous threat. The film leans heavily into chaotic action, fast-paced storytelling, and the unique buddy-comedy energy between its leads. With a darker tone, more brutal fights, and an unhinged villain, Let There Be Carnage dives deeper into the twisted world of symbiotes while continuing to explore Eddie and Venom’s evolving relationship.</p>

            <img class="movie_post" src="images/Venom_The_Last_Dance_Poster.jpg" alt="venom the last dance">
            <p>The final installment in the trilogy brings everything to a head. Eddie and Venom are now fugitives, hunted by both the government and a growing threat from the symbiote homeworld. As the boundaries between Earth and the symbiote dimension begin to blur, the stakes are raised to a cosmic level. With enemies closing in from all sides and their survival on the line, Eddie and Venom must make choices that could alter the future of both worlds. The film balances explosive action with emotional depth, exploring themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and identity. Tensions rise as Eddie is forced to confront what it truly means to share his body and life with Venom — and what they are willing to lose to protect the people they care about. The Last Dance delivers a bold, emotional conclusion to a trilogy that’s as much about inner demons as it is about aliens and anti-heroes.</p>
