        <h1 class="heading_style">Venom in Comics</h1>
        <p>Venom's debut in the comics set the stage for decades of storytelling. His relationship with Spider-Man created one of the most memorable rivalries in comic book history, and his subsequent solo adventures solidified him as one of Marvel's most popular characters.

            Venom has appeared in numerous comic series, including Venom: Lethal Protector, Venom: The Madness, and Venom: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., among others. These stories explored his evolution from a Spider-Man adversary to a complex anti-hero, tackling themes of redemption, vengeance, and the dark side of humanity.</p>
            <h2 class="heading_style">Venom in Movies</h2>
            <p>Venom made his live-action debut in Spider-Man 3 (2007), portrayed by Topher Grace. However, it wasn’t until 2018 that Venom got his own standalone film, with Tom Hardy playing Eddie Brock. The film delves into Eddie’s struggle with the symbiote and explores his evolution as a reluctant hero. The 2018 Venom film was a commercial success and led to a sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), which introduced the character of Carnage, a more dangerous symbiote with a stronger desire for chaos.

                The movies take a slightly different approach compared to the comics, focusing more on Eddie Brock’s relationship with the symbiote and their journey as an unlikely duo.</p>
                <h3 class="heading_style">Venom's Impact on Pop Culture</h3>
                <p>Venom has become an iconic character in pop culture, recognized not only by comic book fans but also by a wider audience through film, TV shows, and video games. His distinctive look—a giant black creature with a menacing grin and white spider symbol—has made him an instantly recognizable figure in the Marvel Universe.

                    In addition to the films, Venom has appeared in various animated series such as Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Venom: The Animated Series, as well as video games like the Spider-Man series and the Marvel’s Avengers game.
                    
                    Venom’s appeal lies in his complexity. As both a villain and an anti-hero, he represents the struggle between inner darkness and the desire to do good. His relationship with Eddie Brock, filled with conflict, love, and hate, adds layers to his character, making him relatable to many fans.</p>
